Flutter Location Tracker - README
**Project Overview**
A real-time location tracking app built with Flutter featuring live location updates, address details, location history, and interactive map visualization using Google APIs.
 APIs Used
1. Geolocator API

Fetches real-time GPS coordinates with high accuracy
Listens to location changes with 10-meter distance filter
Updates triggered automatically when user moves

2. Geocoding API

Converts latitude/longitude to readable addresses
Extracts city, state, and postal code from coordinates
Provides reverse geocoding for all location updates

3. Google Maps Flutter API

Displays interactive map with current location marker
Shows location history with multiple markers
Draws polyline path showing user movement trail

**Features Implemented**
1.Permission handling (granted/denied/permanently denied states)
2.Current location display (lat/lng, city, state, pincode, timestamp)
3.Real-time location updates on movement
4.Location history list with chronological timestamps
5.MVVM architecture (Model-View-ViewModel pattern)
6.Bonus: Interactive map with markers and path visualization
7.Bonus: Dark/light theme support
**Architecture**
MVVM Pattern with clean separation:

Model: LocationModel - Data structure for location info
ViewModel: LocationViewModel - Business logic, permission handling, location updates
View: LocationScreen, MapScreen - UI components

State Management: Provider (ChangeNotifier) for reactive UI updates and in-memory storage.
💡 How My Experience Helped
State Management: Chose Provider for its simplicity and efficiency. Implemented ChangeNotifier pattern to reactively update UI when location changes, keeping all data in-memory without database complexity.
Permission Flow: Designed comprehensive permission handling covering all scenarios (denied, granted, permanently denied) with clear UI feedback and action buttons, ensuring users can always enable location access.
Real-time Optimization: Configured location updates with 10m distance filter to balance accuracy and battery life. Used stream-based approach for non-blocking continuous tracking.
API Integration: Efficiently integrated Geocoding API with proper async/await handling for smooth address resolution. Implemented error handling with user-friendly messages for network failures or API errors.
UX Design: Applied Material Design 3 with consistent spacing and responsive layouts. Added loading indicators, error banners, and empty states for better user experience.
